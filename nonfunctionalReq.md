Great ‚Äî for a **Notification Service at scale**, it's essential to define strong **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**. Here's a comprehensive list of NFRs you can consider and categorize in your architecture/design document:

---

## üöÄ Non-Functional Requirements for Notification Service

### 1. **Scalability**

* The service should horizontally scale to handle millions of events per day.
* Kafka consumers and dispatchers should be independently scalable per channel (e.g., email, SMS, push).
* Use of stateless services to allow load balancing and scaling via Kubernetes or auto-scaling groups.

### 2. **Availability**

* Target availability: 99.9% (or higher).
* Deploy services in multiple availability zones.
* Retry mechanisms for downstream failures (e.g., mail gateway timeout).
* Use circuit breakers to avoid cascading failures.

### 3. **Latency**

* End-to-end latency from event ingestion to delivery should be within:

  * ‚è±Ô∏è < 500ms for SMS/Push notifications.
  * ‚è±Ô∏è < 2 seconds for emails.

### 4. **Throughput**

* Capable of processing **at least 10K+ events per second**.
* Kafka partitioning and batching should be optimized for high throughput.

### 5. **Reliability**

* Use dead-letter queues (DLQs) for failed notifications.
* Persist delivery status in tracking DB for auditing.
* Ensure at-least-once event delivery using Kafka offset management.

### 6. **Observability**

* Centralized logging using tools like ELK or Grafana Loki.
* Metrics on:

  * Events received/processed per second
  * Delivery success/failure per channel
  * Latency and retry counts
* Tracing via OpenTelemetry for E2E visibility across microservices.

### 7. **Security**

* API access secured via OAuth2 or JWT-based authentication.
* Role-based access control (RBAC) for admin functions (template editing, config changes).
* PII (email, phone) encryption at rest and in transit.
* Use HTTPS/TLS for all service-to-service communication.

### 8. **Data Retention & Archiving**

* Retain delivery logs and tracking data for 30‚Äì90 days (configurable).
* Archive older records to object storage like S3 or Glacier.

### 9. **Compliance**

* GDPR/CCPA compliance:

  * Consent management (via user preferences)
  * Data erasure support
* Audit logging for template and preference changes

### 10. **Extensibility**

* Support for adding new channels (e.g., WhatsApp, Slack) without major changes.
* Template placeholders and rendering engine should support complex conditional logic.

### 11. **Disaster Recovery**

* Backup template and preference DBs daily.
* Cross-region replication for critical services like Kafka and PostgreSQL.
* Failover strategies documented and tested.

### 12. **Maintainability**

* Microservices should be modular and loosely coupled.
* Clear API documentation via Swagger/OpenAPI.
* Well-commented codebase with automated testing and CI/CD pipelines.

Here is the **NFR-to-service mapping section** you've asked for, already appended at the end of your Low-Level Design document:
